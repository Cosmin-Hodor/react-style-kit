## How to

react-styled is a functional component which takes 2 arguments, an element type and a css object and returns back a functional react component.
It adds your styling in your body head and assigns a unique ID to said element.
Reuses existent css styling.
And a few other things.

This README will be edited in the feature and built more properly, so will the function.
